# PawConnect - Atrina Hackathon'25

## Track
Social Good

## Problem Statement 
Stray animals and pets often suffer from undiagnosed diseases due to a lack of accessible and affordable veterinary care. Many potential adopters and shelters lack the expertise to recognize signs of illness, which can delay treatment and result in worsening conditions. There is also no unified system for accurately detecting diseases in animals using technology, making early intervention challenging.

Key challenges:

- Lack of tools for quick and accurate animal disease diagnosis based on symptoms or visible signs (e.g., wounds, infections).
- Difficulty for shelters and NGOs to prioritize medical needs of animals due to resource constraints.
- Limited awareness among adopters about animal health conditions.


## Overview
PawConnect integrates advanced AI-powered disease detection tools into a unified platform for animal welfare. The platform enables users (shelters, NGOs, adopters, and veterinarians) to diagnose diseases using image and symptom-based inputs. By offering accurate recommendations and connecting users with veterinarians, PawConnect aims to improve animal health outcomes while streamlining other aspects like adoption and municipal partnerships.

The disease detection feature will serve as the core offering, complemented by tools for adoption, collaboration, and resource allocation.

## Core Features: Animal Disease Detection
### Image-Based Detection
**AI-Powered Analysis:**

Users upload images of the affected animal (e.g., wounds, rashes, eye conditions).
AI model analyzes the image to detect visible signs of diseases like infections, injuries, or skin conditions.
Output includes probable diagnosis, severity level, and recommended next steps.
Integration with Veterinary Database:

Cross-reference AI findings with veterinary datasets for accuracy.
Provide users with a list of nearby veterinarians for further consultation.
Educational Suggestions:

Show prevention tips, first aid measures, and care guides for specific conditions.
### Symptom-Based Detection
**Interactive Symptom Checker:**

Users input details like:
Symptoms observed (e.g., vomiting, lethargy, coughing).
Behavior changes (e.g., aggression, loss of appetite).
Environment (e.g., exposure to ticks or unhygienic conditions).
The system suggests possible conditions based on the inputs.

**Severity Assessment:**

Highlight urgent cases needing immediate veterinary attention.
Offer treatment suggestions for non-critical cases (e.g., hydration, dietary changes).
Disease Trends Monitoring:

Track and report disease patterns in specific regions for NGOs and municipal corporations to act upon.
**Additional Platform Features**
For NGOs and Shelters
Disease Prioritization:

Flag animals needing immediate medical care using detection results.
Access subsidized or volunteer veterinary services for urgent cases.

**Collaboration with Municipalities:**

Share data on disease outbreaks (e.g., rabies hotspots) to plan vaccination drives.
Organize sterilization campaigns for controlling stray animal populations.

**For Adopters**
Health Transparency:
Provide detailed health reports for animals listed for adoption, including past diseases and treatments.
Highlight animals that need special care due to ongoing medical conditions.

**For Veterinarians**
AI-Assisted Diagnosis:

Use AI detection tools as a supplement during consultations.
Receive pre-diagnosis reports from shelters or adopters for quicker case handling.
Volunteer Opportunities:

Offer free or subsidized services for NGOs or municipal programs.

## Impact Goals
- Improve Early Diagnosis: Enable shelters, NGOs, and adopters to detect diseases early, reducing suffering and medical expenses.
- Support Stray Animal Welfare: Empower municipalities to track and mitigate disease outbreaks.
- Boost Adoptions: Provide adopters with transparent health information, encouraging informed decisions.
- Enhance Veterinary Reach: Allow veterinarians to extend their services to underserved areas through telemedicine and AI tools.
